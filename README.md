# CycIC-2: Cyc Intelligence Challenge

## The dataset

This repository contains the revised version of the Cyc Intelligence Challenge (CycIC). CycIC-2 is a common sense knowledge and reasoning task consisting of 4,000 common sense questions that were automatically generated by Cyc. The question set contains a mix of questions from the original CycIC question set - which were generated from Cyc’s question generation templates - and questions that have been newly generated from Cyc’s internal common sense test suite. The questions cover a broad range of common sense topics, including logic, time, physical space, culture, and common events. The repository also contains a 400 question dev set and a 100 question training set. Also included is an evaluation script that takes a simple .lst prediction file, with one answer per line in the same order as the corresponding questions.
Humans achieved 98% accuracy on the question set.
